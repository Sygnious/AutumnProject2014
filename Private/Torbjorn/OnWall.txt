KEY QUESTIONS:
- What is the suitable algorithm for DMA?
- Should DMA be on tile, or integrated on all other data transferring tiles?
(These two likely affect one another)
*
- How will dark silicon affect into this?
- What about energy efficiency?


TODO:
- #1: Get fully(?) detailed information on SHMAC's interconnection network. Especially about how the tiles deal with sending data to one another.
- Find proper sources on DMA, rather than wikipedia
- Read up on related work. Ideas: Intel I7, AMD, ARM, AMD DirectGMA.
- Begin discussing milestones.
- Begin discussing how to split the project down into tasks, and how to implement Scrum (or something similar) (quite possible to discuss with the teachers)
