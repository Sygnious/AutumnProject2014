KEY QUESTIONS:
- What is the suitable algorithm for DMA?
- Should DMA be on tile, or integrated on all other data transferring tiles?
(These two likely affect one another)

- How will dark silicon affect into this?
- What about energy efficiency?
- What about Cache Coherency issues?


TODO:
- Project organization:
	- Review remaining time of entire project
	- Set up major tasks. Estimate time they take.
	- Decide for milestones. 
	- Begin splitting down into lesser tasks. At least for the nearest time.
	- Decide if we go for Scrum, or not. Should discuss with teachers. NOTE: We're only 2 people, Scrum may not apply.
- Get fully(?) detailed information on SHMAC's interconnection network. Especially about how the tiles deal with sending data to one another.
- Find proper sources on DMA, rather than wikipedia
- Read up on related work. Ideas: Intel I7, AMD, ARM, AMD DirectGMA.
