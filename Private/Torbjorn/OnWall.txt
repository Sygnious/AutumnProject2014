KEY QUESTIONS:
- What is the suitable algorithm for DMA?
- Should DMA be on tile, or integrated on all other data transferring tiles? 
	(answered: Only use of space matters, otherwise same principle)

- Does data arrive sequentially?
- Allow store attempts outside DMA?
- How much problem of overlapping write/read from two different processors? (General problem for the processors, I assume)

- What about energy efficiency?
- What about Cache Coherency issues?
- Note: Must be able to adapt for virtual memory expansions to the system


TODO:
- Project organization:
	- Review remaining time of entire project
	- Set up major tasks. Estimate time they take.
	- Decide for milestones. 
	- Begin splitting down into lesser tasks. At least for the nearest time.
- Find proper sources on DMA, rather than wikipedia
- Read up on related work. Ideas: Intel I7, AMD, ARM, AMD DirectGMA.

- Improve design of DMA modules. Read
- Design a fourth scheme before thursday.
