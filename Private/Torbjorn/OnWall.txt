KEY QUESTIONS:
- What is the suitable algorithm for DMA?
- Should DMA be on tile, or integrated on all other data transferring tiles? 
	(answered: Only use of space matters, otherwise same principle)

- Does data arrive sequentially?
- Allow store attempts outside DMA?
- How much problem of overlapping write/read from two different processors? (General problem for the processors, I assume)

- What about energy efficiency?
- What about Cache Coherency issues?
	- How does a processor know when a DMA device overwrites data it has cached?
- Note: Must be able to adapt for virtual memory expansions to the system


TODO:
- Project organization:
	- Review remaining time of entire project
	- Set up major tasks. Estimate time they take.
	- Decide for milestones. 
	- Begin splitting down into lesser tasks. At least for the nearest time.
- Find proper sources on DMA, rather than wikipedia
- Read up on related work. Ideas: Intel I7, AMD, ARM, AMD DirectGMA.

- Design a fourth scheme before thursday.

Question notes from PIC24F:
- Change SRC/DST addressing by SIZE after transfer?
- Should we allow programmable registers for different modes and addressing, ETC. ETC. ? Or hardcode everything?
- Interrupts:
	- Before end (to DMA)?
	- Should have (both to and from)?
	- At least needs (both to and from)?
- Allow interrupts to DMA before end? What interrupts should we have? What do we at least need? (Both to and from DMA module
- Who are allowed to trigger the DMA module?
- Software invoke not part of task now, but should we allow a future possibility?
- What type of restrictions may be necessary?
- How about Load 1, store many?
- Are triggersignals necessary (as for one-shot or repeated one-shot)?
- Allow loadable external index?
- What modes should we include? (At least Block-block)
- How do we handle multiple requests?
- General purpose DMA vs special-programmed DMA?
- Include any type of idle mode, sleep mode, etc?
