Heterogeneous architectures are a possible solution for the problem known as
dark silicon. Using multiple cores with varying sizes and capabilities, one
can attain good performance and energy efficiency for many problems.

Bitcoin mining is a problem which is focused on solving SHA-256 hashes in
order to find a hash with a certain numeric value. This report develops
a prototype for accelerating the calculation of such hashes for future
inclusion into the SHMAC architecture. Using the developed accelerator
provides a speed-up of 19 times over a software implementation running on
a Microblaze processor.

In addition, a DMA module is developed in order to do low-overhead memory
transfers in order to increase the energy performance
of the system by allowing CPU to do other work or enter sleep states.
Using a DMA with the hashing accelerator provides a speed-up of 14 times over
using a software implementation, but allows the CPU to sleep, saving power.
The DMA is designed for future inclusion into the SHMAC architecture.
