\section{Hasing module}

\subsection{Test Setup}
In order to evaluate the performance increase obtained when using a dedicated
hashing accelerator, a test system-on-chip was constructed using Xilinx' Vivado
development studio.

\end{figure}

The test system is controlled by a MicroBlaze microprocessor, configured to
include the optional barrel shifter, integer divider and pattern comparator extensions.
In order to run the XilKernel real-time operating system, the system also
includes a simple timer module for use by the kernel.

A UartLite module was included to provide I/O in order to communicate with
the system from a desktop computer, as well as a GPIO module for additional
debugging use.

The system runs on a 50~MHz clock which is synthesized by a clock generator
module from a 100~MHz input clock.

In order to run performance tests on the system, the DMA described in
section \ref{undefined}\todo{Insert correct reference here} and four
SHA256 hashing modules are included.\todo{Maybe reduce to one now}
A fixed-interval timer, that generates an interrupt every second, is
included in order to calculate the performance per second.

\subsection{Test Software}
In order to test the hashing modules and how the performance scales when including
additional hashing modules, a benchmark application was written. The benchmark
runs a specified number of threads that tries to hash a single block of data
over and over again.

A simple scheduler is used to provide each thread with an available hashing module.
If no module is available, the thread blocks on a semaphore until a module is available.

Once a second, the number of completed hashes for each module is added up and
reported over the UART.

The test software is also designed so that it can be run with a software implementation
of the hashing algorithm instead of the hashing modules. This makes it possible
to compare the performance when using an accelerator as compared to not using
an accelerator.\todo{Update test software description.}

\subsection{Measurements and Benchmarks}
The most important performance measure for a Bitcoin mining system is the number
of hashes per second it can sustain. Therefore, once a second the number of hashes
computed since the previous second is calculated and sent over the UART.

Another important measurement is how the inclusion of a DMA affects the performance
of the system.

\subsection{Measuring DMA Performance}

In the test system, a load takes at least 2 cycles, and a store takes at least 3 cycles.
Branching and incrementation takes at least 1 cycle each.
For $M$ data, the total transfer for the CPU takes at least $(3 + 2 + 1 + 1)M = 7M$ cycles, for the loop only.

If a DMA module is present, it can relieve the CPU for this work, letting the CPU focus on other work, saving it $7M$ cycles for each transfer, excepting overhead such as activating the DMA module and handling interrupts when done.
In addition, a well designed DMA module may have less overhead, enabling better \todo{With more than one channel active, a transfer does not necessarily become faster by itself} throughput.

A program with $M$ data to be transferred will be used, and the number of clock cycles spent on other work than data transfer for the CPU will be measured.
A comparison between running with and without the DMA module will be done, to see if the CPU can spend at least $7M$ more cycles of work on other tasks.

% Also, I think our existing test measures the improvements well enough and gives numbers to calculate how much work the CPU can do while the DMA works. -K.
