\chapter{Conclusion}

The performance gains attained from using an accelerator in conjunction with a DMA
proves the usefulness of using an accelerator for SHA-256 hashing.

With the modules inserted into SHMAC, a full bitcoin mining system can be
constructed that can take advantage of power savings from not having to do
the hashing and data transfers involved in software. Using SHMAC for mining
bitcoins will possibly be the very first time a heterogeneous architecture
is used for bitcoin mining.
