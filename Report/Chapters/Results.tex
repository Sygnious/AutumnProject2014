\chapter{Results}

Two measurements were made in order to evaluate the performance of the hashing accelerator.
The number of hashes per second were measured both when using a DMA for data transfer
between RAM and the hashing tile and when not using a DMA. The results are compared
to a software implementation of the algorithm running on the MCU.
