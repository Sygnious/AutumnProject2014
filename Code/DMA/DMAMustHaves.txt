DMA must have:
(potential expansions in parantese)

Input: 
- Start address (32 bit)
- End address (32 bit)
- Number of data to be transfered
- ID of requestor (may be removed, depending on scheme)
- (stride)

Transfer:
- Data buffer
- Count buffer
- Buffer for storing ID of requestor (may be removed, depending on scheme)
- (stride buffer)
- (TLB)
- (Multiple channels (goal: few, as 2?))

Output:
- Load requests  (same as processor, but must be recongnized as DMA module)
- Store requests
- Interruption to requestor
