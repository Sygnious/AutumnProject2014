Microinstructions

Minimal:

- Load data from range X, store at range Y
- 	Range = Start address + Count
- 	Does not care where in the system it is. Cares only about the two locations for data load and data store

Expanded (co-operating DMAs):

- Load data from range X, store at LOCAL range Y (Local DMA at storing tile)
- Load and send data from LOCAL range to extern tile (DMA at loading tile cooperates with storing DMA)

- Pass on requests/interrupts (DMA on PU tile does the initial pass on request instead of PU)
